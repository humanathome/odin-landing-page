## The Odin Project: Landing Page 
This is the [landing page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) 
from the **Foundations** section.
The goal is to create the project as close to the given design (preferably using Flexbox), and substitute
the placeholders with your own content.
Design template, together with colors and fonts, can be found in the **directions** folder.
